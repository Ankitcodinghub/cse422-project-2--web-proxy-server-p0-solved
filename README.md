1 Goals

Apply your knowledge of socket programming in order to implement a real-life application and gain some basic understanding of HTTP.

2 Overview

In this project, you will implement a simple proxy server for HTTP that forwards requests from clients to end servers and returns responses from end servers to the clients.

2.1 The HyperText Transfer Protocol, HTTP

The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)Add is the World Wide Web‚Äôs application-layer protocol. HTTP operates by having a client (usually the browser) initiate a connection to a server, send some request, and then read the server‚Äôs response. HTTP defines the structure of these messages and how the clients and servers exchange messages.

A web object is simply a file, such as an HTML file, a JPEG image, or a video clip. A web page usually consists of one HTML file with several referenced objects. A page or an object is addressed by a single Uniform Resource Locator (URL). When one wants to access a HTML page, the web browser initiates a request to the server and asks for the HTML file. If the request is successful, the server replies to the web browser with a response that contains the HTML file. The web browser examines the HTML file, identifies the referenced objects, and for each referenced object, initiates a request to retrieve the object.

Request

GET /~cse422/F13u/CSE422.txt HTTP/1.1

Connection: close

Host: www.cse.msu.edu

[blank line]

Response

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Accept-Ranges: bytes

Connection: close

Content-Length: 59

Content-Type: text/plain

ETag: ‚Äú142b104-3b-4e6777abb53c9‚Äù

Server: Apache/2.2.22 (Debian)

[blank line]

This is an example downloadable file for CSE422 FS13 lab2.

Figure 1: Example HTTP request and response message. In the request, the client asks for CSE422.txt from the Department‚Äôs web server www.cse.msu.edu over HTTP/1.1. In the server‚Äôs response, the server informs the client that the request was successful with the statusAdd code 200 and several additional header lines that carry information about this response. Note that each line is ended by a CRLF.

There are eight request methods that indicate what the client wants the server to do. In this project, we consider only the GET method, which is used to request objects from the server. The GET request must include the path to the object the client wishes to download and the HTTP version. In the above example, the path is /~cse422/F13u/CSE422.txt and the HTTP version is HTTP/1.1. Some request methods (such as POST) that transmit data to the server include the data in a message body. However, the GET method does not have a message body.

In its response, the server indicates the HTTP version, status code and status description. The status code and status description indicate whether the request was successful and, if not, why the request failed. Common status codes and status description include

‚Ä¢ 200 OK: Request succeeded

‚Ä¢ 403 Forbidden: The request failed because access to the resource is not allowed.

‚Ä¢ 404 Not Found: The request is failed because the referenced object could not be found.

‚Ä¢ 500 Internal Server Error: There is something wrong at the server side.

‚Ä¢ RFC 2612: HTTP/1.1 and RFC 1945: HTTP/1.0

2.2 Proxy Server [Wikipedia Entry]

As shown in Figure 2, a proxy server is a program that acts as a middleman between a client and an end server. Instead of requesting an object from the server directly, the client sends the request to the proxy, which forwards the request to the server. When the server replies to the proxy, the proxy returns the response to the requesting client.

Add

Figure 2: The client sends request to the proxy and the proxy forwards the request to the server. The proxy awaits the server‚Äôs response and returns it to the client.

Proxies are used for many purposes. Sometimes proxies are used as firewalls, such that the proxy is the only way for a client behind a firewall to contact any server outside. Proxies are also used as anonymizers. By removing or modifying a request header, a proxy can make the client anonymous to the server. By examining the request header, a proxy can filter and block requests, for example, blocking any request where the URL contains the keyword ‚Äùfacebook‚Äù.

An important application of proxies is to cache web objects by storing a copy when the first request is made, and then serving that copy in response to future requests rather than going to the server. For large business or ISPs, caching frequently requested object can reduce the communication cost.

3A simple HTTP client

In order to understand the HTTP message exchange and to focus on the implementation of proxy, a simple command line HTTP client is provided to you along with the skeleton code [link]. Several classes are provided along with this simple HTTP client, which can help you construct the proxy.

Usage: ./client [options]

The following options are available:

-s host URL

-p proxy URL

-h display help message

The URL to the desired web object must be specified by the argument -s. -p argument is optional.

Example invocation without proxy:

./client -s http://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse422/F13u/CSE422.txt

This invocation does exactly the same thing as in Figure 1 and stores a copy of CSE422.txt in Download folder under current directory.

Example invocation with proxy running on smithers.cse.msu.edu at port 20987:

./client -s http://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse422/F13u/CSE422.txt -p smithers.cse.msu.edu:29487Add

3.1 Initiating a Request

To initiate a request, the HTTP client has to connect to the server, construct a request message and send the message to the server (or proxy, depend on how the client is invoked, in the following of this section, server means either end server or proxy server.). The TCP Socket class provides the functionality for the communications and handles details of setting up the socket.

Processing HTTP messages requires a lot of string parsing and formatting. A URL class is provided to help you parse the given URL and store it as an object. The method URL::parse takes a string as the argument and returns the pointer to the parsed URL object if the string is a valid URL, or NULL otherwise.

An HTTP Request class is provided to handle the construction of new HTTP requests, for sending/receiving of requests, and for parsing an incoming HTTP request (which is not needed by the client, but is needed by the proxy.)

We summarize the initiation and sending of requests as follows:

‚Ä¢ Parse the server URL string by invoking URL::parse.

‚Ä¢ Create a TCP Socket object: TCP Socket client sock. The method client sock.Connect connects to the corresponding server.

‚Ä¢ Create an HTTP Request object request by invoking HTTP Request::create GET request.

‚Ä¢ Configure this HTTP Request. ‚Ä¢ The method HTTP Request::send(client sock) sends the request to the server.

3.2 Handle the Response

Next, the client expects the HTTP response from the server. We also provide an HTTP Response class for sending/receiving of requests, for parsing of incoming HTTP response, and to handle the creation of new HTTP requests (which is not needed by the client, but is needed by the proxy). Add

Handling the responses is a two-step procedure, first handling the response header and then the response body. Two steps are needed because the length of the message body varies, and the client does not know in advance when to stop receiving incoming data. When a process invokes the read/recv system call, the system call returns the number of bytes received or the process is blocked and waits for incoming bytes. Without knowing the length of the message body, the client does not know when to stop calling read/recv. Therefore, a client has to receive the header first and examine the header fields to determine the number of bytes to expect in the body.

There are several transfer encoding mechanisms in HTTP and in this project, we only care about two transfer encoding mechanisms, identity encoding and chunked transfer encoding. The message header comprises several lines, each ending with a CRLF, and the end of the header is marked by a blank line. The client keeps reading one line of data until two consecutive CRLFs are found in the buffer; the rest of incoming data belong to response body. The read header method is provided in both HTTP Request and HTTP Response. If you wish to handle the data yourself, the method read line is provided in TCP Socket.

3.2.1 Identity Encoding

Identity encoding is the default transfer encoding mechanism defined in HTTP. The Transfer-Encoding line is not present in the header. The Content-Length line specifies the length of the response body explicitly. The client simply receives this specified amount of data and stores it as the response body.

3.2.2Chunked Transfer Encoding

Each chunk is separated by a CRLF and begins with a hexadecimal chunk size followed by an extra CRLF. After reading the header, if this response is in chunked transfer encoding, the client reads one more line, which indicates the length of the first chunk. The client receives data until the chunk is completely downloaded. The client reads two more lines, the first line is the blank line between chunks and the second line is the size of next chunk. The client continues this process until it receives a zero chunk size, which indicates the end of the transfer.

3.3 Response SummaryAdd

The process of receiving the response is summarized as follows:

‚Ä¢ Create an HTTP response object.

‚Ä¢ Receive the response header by invoking HTTP Response::receive header and parse it.

‚Ä¢ Receive the response body. You can check if this response is chunked by invoking HTTP Response::is chunked.

‚Ä¢ Store the received data as a file.

4 Specification

To help with debugging, you are required to add/modify a field in the response header, saying that this response is returned by your proxy. Specifically, you are required to add (or modify) the field Server with a string, such as your MSU NetID, showing the header has been modified. The method HTTP Response::set header field is able to do this.

The proxy is expected to respond with error messages to bad requests. For a request that tries to download an object from a host that does not exist, the proxy returns a 404 Not Found response. As long as the end server exists, the case when the requested web object that does not exist is handled by the end server. The proxy simply forwards the request and returns the response.

The proxy is expected to perform simple filtering. Specifically, the proxy rejects any request to any host that contains the keyword ‚Äùfacebook,‚Äù but allows request to ‚Äùpath‚Äù that contains the keyword ‚Äùfacebook.‚Äù The proxy returns a403 Forbidden response for the former request. For example, the proxy rejects the requests to www.facebook.com and forwards requests to http://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse422/F13u/facebook.txt

The proxy is required to handle both default transfer encoding and chunked transfer encod- ing. For default transfer encoding, the proxy is required to display (print to the console) the content length. For chunked transfer encoding, the proxy is required to display (print to the

console) the length of all chunks.Add

4.1 The Work Flow of the Proxy

We outline the work flow of this proxy in this section. The proxy starts running and waits for incoming connections. For each connection, the proxy has to do the following:

‚Ä¢ Get the request string from the client, check if the request is valid by parsing it. (the method HTTP Request::receive receives the request and parse it at once.)

‚Ä¢ From the parsed HTTP request object, obtain the server address by invoking

HTTP Request::get host. Also check the validity of this server address by invoking URL::parse. If this server is invalid (returned NULL), respond this request by a 404 Not Found. If we are blocking this server, respond this request by a 403 forbidden.

‚Ä¢ Forward this request to the server by invoking HTTP Request::send.

‚Ä¢ Receive the response header and modify Server header field. (HTTP Response::set header field)

‚Ä¢ Receive the response body. Handle both default and chunked encoding transfer.

‚Ä¢ Return the modified response to the client.

The proxy returns a 404 Not Found response to the client as long as it cannot reach the server specified in the request, such as

‚Ä¢ The parsed server URL is NULL, which means the URL is not valid.

‚Ä¢ Fail to connect to the server.

‚Ä¢ Unable to resolve the server URL.

‚Ä¢ Server does not exist.

‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¶ etc.

When the servers respond 403 or 404 messages, the content/body of the response is usually a webpage showing related information. However, the provided HTTP Response class constructor only constructs responses with header only. In this project, your proxy servers do not need to provide response content/body. It is fine as long as the header is correct. A skeleton file is provided to you along with the simple client. [link].

5 Deliverables Add

You will submit your project using the handin utility. Please submit all files in your project directory. If you start your project with the skeleton code, submit all files, even for files that are not modified. Please name your zipfile ‚Äòproject2.zip‚Äò. The zipfile should only contain all the files, not any folders.

The compilation must be done using a makefile. The code should compile and link on the arctic or black machines. (See Section 7. bullet 1) You will not be awarded any point if your submission does not compile using makefile. Please test your programs before handing them in.

A README file is required. You will run your proxy with the client program provided and record the log in your README file. A sample README file is also included in the skeleton code. You are also encouraged to include any comment in the README file.

7 Notes

‚Ä¢ Please develop your program on your own machines, instead of the servers. Because we are working on multi-process programs, we might overrun the servers. If possible, make sure your program compiles on arctic or black before submitting.

‚Ä¢ This project only uses non-persistent connections. The constructor of HTTP Request class sets the Connection header to close for you already.

‚Ä¢ Please spend some time tracing the code in the provided classes. One should be able to build the entire proxy using those classes. Tracing the client code would be a good start.

‚Ä¢ Obviously, the default transfer encoding is easier to implement than chunked transfer encoding. For your convenience, the requests to the following URLs are guaranteed to reply with default encoding responses. In fact, responses to most web objects that are not HTMLs should be default transfer encoding.

‚Äì http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/python-2.7.3.amd64.msi It might take up to a minute. It is a big file.

‚Ä¢ This project does not require the proxy to work with real browsers. However, if the functions required in this project are implemented correctly, this proxy should be able to work with real browsers and should be able to display most web pages.
